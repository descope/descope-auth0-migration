# Descope Auth0 User Migration Tool

This repository includes a Python utility for migrating your Auth0 users, organizations, permissions, and roles to Descope.

## Setup üíø

1. Clone the Repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:descope/descope-auth0-migration.git
```

2. Create a Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the Necessary Python libraries

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Setup Your Environment Variables

You can change the name of the `.env.example` file to `.env` to use as a template.

```
AUTH0_TOKEN=Your_Auth0_Token // Required, this is generated within Auth0
AUTH0_TENANT_ID=Your_Auth0_Tenant_ID // Required, this is the tenant ID of your tenant within Auth0
DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=Your_Descope_Project_ID // Required, this is your Descope ProjectId
DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY=Your_Descope_Project_ID // Required, this is your Descope Management Key
```

a. To get an Auth0 token, go [here](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis/management/explorer), then copy the token to your
`.env` file. These tokens are only valid for 24 hours by default.

b. To get your Auth0 Tenant ID, it can be found in the URL of your Auth0 dashboard. For example, when you login to Auth0, your URL might look something like this:

```
https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/dev-xyz/
```

Your tenant ID is: `dev-xyz`. You can also read more about it [here](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/tenant-settings/find-your-tenant-name-or-tenant-id).

c. To get your Descope Project ID, go [here](https://app.descope.com/settings/project), then copy the token to your
`.env` file.

d. To create a Descope Management Key, go [here](https://app.descope.com/settings/company/managementkeys), then copy
the token to your `.env` file.

5. The tool depends on a few custom user attributes you need to create within Descope to assist you with the migration. The below outlines the machine names of the attributes to create within the [user's custom attributes](https://app.descope.com/users/attributes) section of the Descope console.

- `connection` (type: text): This custom attribute will contain the different connection types associated to the user which was
  migrated from Auth0.
- `freshlyMigrated` (type: Boolean): This custom attribute will be set to true during the migration. This allows for you
  to later check this via a conditional during Descope flow execution.

Once you've set all of that up, you're ready to run the script.

## Running the Migration Script üöÄ

### Dry run the migration script

You can dry run the migration script which will allow you to see the number of users, tenants, roles, etc which will be migrated
from Auth0 to Descope.

```
python3 src/main.py --dry-run
```

The output would appear similar to the following:

```
Would migrate 112 users from Auth0 to Descope
Would migrate 2 roles from Auth0 to Descope
Would migrate MyNewRole with 2 associated permissions.
Would migrate Role with 0 associated permissions.
Would migrate 2 organizations from Auth0 to Descope
Would migrate Tenant 1 with 5 associated users.
Would migrate Tenant 2 with 4 associated users.
```

### Live run the migration Script

To migrate your Auth0 users, simply run the following command:

```
python3 src/main.py
```

The output will include the responses of the created users, organizations, roles, and permissions as well as the mapping between the various objects within Descope:

The output will include the responses of the created users, organizations, roles, and permissions as well as the mapping between the various objects within Descope. A log file will also be generated in the format of `migration_log_%d_%m_%Y_%H:%M:%S.log`. Any items which failed to be migrated will also be listed with the error that occurred during the migration.

### Post Migration Verification

Once the migration tool has ran successfully, you can check the [users](https://app.descope.com/users),
[roles](https://app.descope.com/authorization), [permissions](https://app.descope.com/authorization/permissions),
and [tenants](https://app.descope.com/tenants) for the migrated items from Auth0. You can verify the created items
based on the output of the migration tool.

## Testing üß™

Unit testing can be performed by running the following command:

```
python3 -m unittest tests.test_migration
```
